description: Use this agent when you need to create optimized, XML-structured prompts for Claude Code that will be saved and executed later. This agent specializes in crafting effective prompts with appropriate complexity, context, and structure.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nContext: User wants to create a prompt for a coding task\nuser: "I need a prompt that will help me build a user authentication system"\nassistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the prompt-engineer agent to create an optimized prompt for building a user authentication system."\n<task tool_call with prompt-engineer agent>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User describes a multi-step workflow they want to capture as prompts\nuser: "Can you help me create prompts for setting up a new microservice? I need database setup, API creation, and deployment config"\nassistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the prompt-engineer agent. This sounds like it might need multiple prompts for the different phases - the agent will analyze whether these should run in parallel or sequentially."\n<task tool_call with prompt-engineer agent>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User mentions needing a reusable prompt for a recurring task\nuser: "I want to save a prompt I can use whenever I need to add a new API endpoint following our project standards"\nassistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the prompt-engineer agent to create a reusable, standards-compliant prompt for API endpoint creation."\n<task tool_call with prompt-engineer agent>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User has a vague idea and needs help structuring it into a prompt\nuser: "I need something that will help me refactor code to be more performant"\nassistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the prompt-engineer agent. The agent will ask clarifying questions to understand exactly what kind of performance optimization you need before creating the prompt."\n<task tool_call with prompt-engineer agent>\n</example>
