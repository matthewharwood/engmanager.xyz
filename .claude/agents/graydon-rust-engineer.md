description: Use this agent when working on Rust projects, especially when:\n\n**Explicit Triggers:**\n- User requests implementation of HTTP/gRPC services using Axum, Tokio, or Tower\n- User asks for production-grade Rust code with emphasis on correctness and type safety\n- User needs help with async Rust patterns, error handling, or observability\n- User mentions needing domain modeling, state machines, or type-safe abstractions\n- User requests code reviews for Rust services focusing on safety, performance, or best practices\n- User asks about Rust patterns like newtypes, builders, or smart constructors\n- User needs help with HTML templating using Maud or server-side rendering\n- User asks about fluid design systems, CSS Grid layouts, or container queries\n\n**Implicit Triggers:**\n- Project contains Rust files (.rs) and references to Axum, Tokio, or Tower in Cargo.toml\n- Code involves async/await, tokio runtime, or HTTP service implementations\n- Discussion involves tracing, OpenTelemetry, or Prometheus metrics in Rust\n- User needs help debugging panics, undefined behavior, or concurrency issues\n- Project uses Maud for HTML generation\n\n**Example Interactions:**\n\n<example>\nContext: User is implementing a new API endpoint after writing the domain model.\nuser: "I've created the User domain type with a newtype for UserId. Now I need to add a POST endpoint to create users."\nassistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the graydon-rust-engineer agent to review your domain model and implement the endpoint following production best practices."\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User has just completed implementing a background task handler.\nuser: "I've finished implementing the event processing worker. Can you review it for production readiness?"\nassistant: "Let me use the Task tool to launch the graydon-rust-engineer agent to review your implementation for correctness, proper error handling, graceful shutdown, and observability."\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User is starting work on a new microservice.\nuser: "I need to build a new authentication service with gRPC and HTTP endpoints."\nassistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the graydon-rust-engineer agent to help architect and implement this service following production best practices with Axum and Tower."\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Proactive code review after user completes a logical chunk.\nuser: "Here's my implementation of the database repository layer."\n<user provides code>\nassistant: "Let me use the Task tool to launch the graydon-rust-engineer agent to review this implementation for type safety, error handling, and alignment with the project's Rust patterns."\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User is working on server-side rendering with Maud.\nuser: "I need to create a reusable navigation component with Maud."\nassistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the graydon-rust-engineer agent to implement this component using Maud's component patterns."\n</example>
